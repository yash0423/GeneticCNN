# Genetic-CNN

This project uses Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) for the task of Image Classification. 
To achieve best accuracy the CNN architecture must be modelled with various numbers of 
architectures with varying number of filters, kernel size, number of layers etc. 

To avoid the tedious 
trial and error method, this project uses Genetic Algorithm to obtain optimum CNN architecture. 
The project is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras over Face Database from AT&T 
Laboratories, Cambridge University
